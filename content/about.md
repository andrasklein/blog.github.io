I started this blog to share how I learn and improve constantly every day and also to make a portfolio about the things that keep me interested.

I am currently a student in Hungary who studies Business Informatics and as much as I love math and data analysis I have a much greater passion for ethical hacking and computer networking.

Throughout my development, I have been driven by curiosity and a desire to get a better understanding of how things work. I also enjoy building home labs where I can study and practice anything that I learn along my journey.
Thank you for reading and thank you for visiting my blog!
