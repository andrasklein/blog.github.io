One day, I came across a video by Tyler Ramsbey on YouTube about getting CVEs. One of my goals is to deepen my knowledge in web penetration testing, and I found it a great opportunity to use the knowledge gained on the learning platforms I use. As I study for the OSCP with the Penetration Tester job role path, I think it is a great opportunity to enroll in the Bug Bounty Hunter path and use the knowledge learned from there in real-world applications.

My plan during this process is to acquire new skills and, if I'm lucky, to find a CVE. During the process, I would like to document how I use my newly learned techniques, even if I cannot necessarily see a CVE, of course, the main goal remains to find at least one.

All references or sources used will be documented at the bottom of the page.

***What is a CVE?***

CVE, which stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a catalog of publicly known computer security vulnerabilities.  

***How am I going to approach the CVE-s in a nutshell?***

I have to find a project on Docker Hub that meets the following requirements:

* It has to be open-source.
* It has to be actively maintained.
* Already has at least one prior CVE, because then I know for sure that the development team understands the CVE process.

Lastly, when I work through a module on HTB Academy, such as SQL Injection, I will use the project I choose as my capstone and CTF target.

(This is basically what Tyler advised to follow in his video.)

I used OnlyOffice as my first target, I used the provided steps on the Docker Hub website to set it up locally.
